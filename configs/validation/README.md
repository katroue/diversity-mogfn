# Validation Experiments - Transfer to Real-World Tasks

## Experimental Design Strategy

### Phase 1: Systematic Testing on HyperGrid (Weeks 1-8)
‚úÖ **Fast, cheap, controlled environment**
- Capacity ablation ‚Üí identify best model size
- Sampling ablation ‚Üí identify best exploration strategy
- Loss ablation ‚Üí identify best training objective
- Factorial experiments ‚Üí discover factor interactions

**Output**: 2-3 promising configurations identified

### Phase 2: Validation on Real Tasks (Weeks 9-10) ‚Üê YOU ARE HERE
üéØ **Test generalization to practical applications**
- 3-grams (discrete sequences, text-like)
- Molecule generation (chemical properties)
- Sequence design (protein/biological sequences)

**Goal**: Verify that findings from HyperGrid transfer to real-world problems

## Why This Strategy Works

### Benefits of HyperGrid for Discovery
1. **Fast iteration**: ~24 min per run vs hours for molecules
2. **Controllable**: Clear ground truth, simple reward structure
3. **Interpretable**: Easy to visualize objective space
4. **Reproducible**: Deterministic environment
5. **Scalable**: Can run hundreds of experiments

### Benefits of Real Tasks for Validation
1. **Practical relevance**: Actual use cases
2. **Robustness testing**: Verify generalization
3. **Paper contribution**: Show real-world impact
4. **Failure modes**: Discover limitations

### Risks of Skipping HyperGrid Phase
‚ùå Running experiments on complex tasks first:
- Takes 10-20x longer ‚Üí fewer experiments possible
- Harder to debug ‚Üí unclear what's causing differences
- More confounds ‚Üí task-specific quirks mask general patterns
- Expensive ‚Üí limited budget means fewer seeds, less statistical power

## Validation Tasks

### Task 1: 3-Grams (Discrete Sequences)
**Domain**: Text/sequence generation
**Objectives**:
- Objective 1: Fluency (valid transitions)
- Objective 2: Diversity (vocabulary richness)

**Why this task**:
- Similar to HyperGrid (discrete actions)
- Tests generalization from grid navigation to sequence generation
- Practical application in NLP

**Expected transfer**: ‚úÖ HIGH (both discrete, similar structure)

### Task 2: Molecule Generation
**Domain**: Drug discovery, chemical design
**Objectives**:
- Objective 1: QED (drug-likeness)
- Objective 2: SA (synthesizability)
- Objective 3: Diversity (structural variety)

**Why this task**:
- Real-world application with high impact
- Tests scaling to 3 objectives (HyperGrid was 2)
- Continuous molecular properties from discrete graphs

**Expected transfer**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM (more complex, 3 objectives)

### Task 3: Sequence Design (Protein/DNA)
**Domain**: Computational biology
**Objectives**:
- Objective 1: Stability (folding energy)
- Objective 2: Function (binding affinity)
- Objective 3: Diversity (sequence variety)

**Why this task**:
- Real scientific application
- Long sequences (harder than HyperGrid)
- Tests biological constraints

**Expected transfer**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM-LOW (long sequences, complex constraints)

## Validation Experiment Design

### Selection Criteria
From factorials, select **2-3 configurations**:

**Configuration A: "Winner"**
- Best overall QDS across HyperGrid experiments
- Expected to work well on all tasks

**Configuration B: "Diversity-Focused"** (if different from A)
- Best MCE/TDS on HyperGrid
- May sacrifice some quality for exploration
- Test if diversity emphasis transfers

**Configuration C: "Baseline"**
- Standard settings (Medium + Low temp + TB)
- Control to measure improvement

### Validation Protocol

**For each configuration √ó each task**:
1. Run **5 seeds** for statistical robustness
2. Evaluate on **same metrics**: MCE, TDS, Hypervolume, QDS
3. Compare to task-specific baselines
4. Analyze which aspects transfer vs. task-specific tuning needed

**Total validation runs**: 3 configs √ó 3 tasks √ó 5 seeds = **45 runs**

**Time estimate**:
- 3-grams: ~2 hours per run ‚Üí 30 hours
- Molecules: ~4 hours per run ‚Üí 60 hours
- Sequences: ~6 hours per run ‚Üí 90 hours
- **Total**: ~180 hours sequential, ~18 hours parallel (10 jobs)

## Expected Outcomes

### Scenario 1: Strong Transfer ‚úÖ
**Result**: Winner from HyperGrid is also best on all real tasks
**Implication**: HyperGrid findings are general and robust
**Paper claim**: "Our approach generalizes across domains"

### Scenario 2: Partial Transfer ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Result**: Winner from HyperGrid works well on 3-grams, needs tuning for molecules/sequences
**Implication**: Core principles transfer, but scaling/domain adaptation needed
**Paper claim**: "Our approach provides good starting point, with task-specific refinement"

### Scenario 3: Task-Specific Patterns üìä
**Result**: Different configs win on different tasks
**Implication**: Need to characterize when each approach works
**Paper claim**: "We provide guidelines for selecting approach based on task properties"

### Scenario 4: Failure to Transfer ‚ùå
**Result**: HyperGrid winner doesn't work well on real tasks
**Implication**: HyperGrid may not be representative enough
**Action**: Investigate why, add intermediate-complexity tasks

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Success
- At least one HyperGrid config transfers to at least 2/3 tasks
- Improvement over baseline on at least 1 diversity metric
- Statistical significance (p < 0.05) on at least 1 task

### Good Success
- HyperGrid winner is competitive (top 2) on all tasks
- Consistent patterns in what transfers (e.g., "high temp always helps")
- Clear recommendations for practitioners

### Excellent Success
- HyperGrid winner achieves SOTA on real tasks
- Discover new insights (e.g., "molecules need higher capacity than expected")
- Validation leads to new research questions

## Integration with Main Study

### Timeline
**Weeks 1-6**: Ablation studies on HyperGrid
**Weeks 7-8**: Factorial experiments on HyperGrid
**Week 9**: Analyze all results, select 2-3 best configs
**Week 10**: Validation on 3-grams
**Week 11**: Validation on molecules
**Week 12**: Validation on sequences
**Week 13**: Final analysis, paper writing

### Budget Allocation
- HyperGrid experiments: ~250 runs √ó 24min = 100 hours (cheap exploration)
- Validation experiments: ~45 runs √ó 4hr avg = 180 hours (focused validation)
- **Total**: ~280 hours (reasonable for major study)

### Decision Points

**After Week 9 Analysis**:
- Select 2-3 configs to validate
- May discover unexpected patterns requiring follow-up
- Budget allows ~1 week buffer for additional experiments

**After Week 10 (3-grams)**:
- Quick check: Is anything transferring?
- If yes ‚Üí proceed to molecules/sequences
- If no ‚Üí investigate why, may need intermediate tasks

**After Week 11 (molecules)**:
- Pattern emerging? Adjust sequence experiments if needed
- May skip sequences if budget tight and patterns clear
