# Factorial Experiments Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

The complete infrastructure for running factorial experiments on Multi-Objective GFlowNets has been successfully implemented and tested.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Configuration Files ✅

All factorial experiment configurations are ready:

```
configs/factorials/
├── README.md                           # Complete guide to factorial experiments
├── QUICKSTART.md                       # Quick reference for usage
├── capacity_sampling_2way.yaml         # 3×3 factorial: Capacity × Temperature
├── sampling_loss_2way.yaml             # 3×3 factorial: Temperature × Loss
└── template_factorial.yaml             # Template for custom factorials
```

**Capacity × Sampling Factorial**:
- 3 capacity levels (small 32×2, medium 128×4, large 256×6)
- 3 temperature levels (low 1.0, high 2.0, very_high 5.0)
- 9 conditions × 5 seeds = **45 runs**
- Tests: Does optimal temperature depend on model capacity?

**Sampling × Loss Factorial**:
- 3 temperature levels (1.0, 2.0, 5.0)
- 3 loss types (TB, SubTB, SubTB+Entropy)
- 9 conditions × 5 seeds = **45 runs**
- Tests: Does optimal loss depend on exploration strategy?

### 2. Execution Script ✅

**`scripts/factorials/run_factorial_experiment.py`** - Fully functional script with:

✅ **Configuration Parsing**
- Loads YAML factorial configs
- Parses factor levels and conditions
- Merges parameters into experiment configs
- Generates all condition × seed combinations

✅ **Complete Training Loop**
- Creates HyperGrid environment
- Initializes MOGFN model with correct architecture
- Sets up preference sampler
- Configures optimizer and trainer
- Runs full training (4000 iterations)
- Evaluates with 10,000 final samples

✅ **Comprehensive Metrics**
