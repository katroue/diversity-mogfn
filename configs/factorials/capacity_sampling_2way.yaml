# ============================================================================
# TWO-WAY FACTORIAL: CAPACITY × SAMPLING
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: Test interaction between model capacity and sampling temperature
#
# Research Question: Does optimal sampling strategy depend on model capacity?
# Hypothesis: Small models need lower temperature (limited capacity to explore)
#            Large models benefit from higher temperature (more capacity)
#
# Design: 3 × 3 factorial
#   Factor A (Capacity): small, medium, large
#   Factor B (Temperature): 1.0, 2.0, 5.0
#   Total: 9 combinations × 5 seeds = 45 runs

hypotheses:

  h1_main_capacity:

    prediction: "Medium > Small, Large ≈ Medium (diminishing returns)"
    rationale: "More capacity enables learning diverse policies"

  h2_main_temperature:
    statement: "Temperature has a significant main effect on diversity"
    prediction: "High (τ=2.0) > Low (τ=1.0), Very High (τ=5.0) ≈ High"
    rationale: "Higher temperature increases exploration"

  h3_interaction:
    statement: "There is an interaction between capacity and temperature"
    prediction: "Small models: Low > High (limited capacity), Large models: High > Low"
    rationale: "Small models can't leverage high exploration; large models need it"
    expected_pattern: "Non-parallel lines in interaction plot"

  h4_quality_tradeoff:
    statement: "Quality-diversity tradeoff depends on factor combination"
    prediction: "Large + High achieves best QDS (balanced)"
    rationale: "Capacity for quality, temperature for diversity"
